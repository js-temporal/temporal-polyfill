# 0.5.1

Bug fixes:

- Fix infinite recursion in Node 23.x with `Intl.DurationFormat` (fixes [#329](https://github.com/js-temporal/temporal-polyfill/issues/329)).
- Include correct `package-lock.json` (fixes [#328](https://github.com/js-temporal/temporal-polyfill/issues/328)).
- Don't override TIMEOUT when running `npm run test262`.

Non-breaking changes:

- Support Node 22.x and 23.x and test them in CI (fixes [#323](https://github.com/js-temporal/temporal-polyfill/issues/323)).
- The polyfilled `Intl.DateTimeFormat` object now supports offset time zone identifiers (e.g., `-02:30`) in Node 23.x. Note that the native `Intl.DateTimeFormat` in Node 23.x also supports them, but in a nonstandard way, so you should use the polyfilled `Intl.DateTimeFormat` in your code.
- Add migration guide for 0.4.x → 0.5.0.
- Reduce production bundle size by deleting assertions and minifying function names.

# 0.5.0

Breaking changes:

This major update reflects all changes to the Temporal proposal adopted by TC39 between May 2023 and March 2025.

The majority of these changes were made in the June 2024 TC39 meeting (slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PPMAxVnVjFwRPuJwOvVsw9nZLQ6jDM8Hd5PNO0Grp4I/edit?slide=id.g2e01b5af2da_0_444#slide=id.g2e01b5af2da_0_444)) where the scope of Temporal was reduced at the request of JS engine implementers who were concerned about the size impact of adding Temporal to distributions on limited-capacity devices like low-end Android phones and Apple Watch.

- User-defined calendars have been removed.
  Calendars are now represented by strings representing built-in calendars.
  Without custom calendars, the huge surface area of `Temporal.Calendar` was not necessary, and that type was removed from the proposal.
- User-defined time zones have been removed.
  Time zones are now only represented by string identifiers representing built-in time zones: either a Zone or Link name from the IANA Time Zone Database, or a time zone offset with minutes precision.
  `Temporal.TimeZone` has also been removed, and its methods replaced by the following:
  - `getPreviousTransition`/`getNextTransition` - use the new `getTimeZoneTransition` method of `Temporal.ZoneDateTime`.
  - `equals` - use `ZonedDateTime.prototype.equals` using the same instant and calendar.
  - Other `Temporal.TimeZone` methods can use the corresponding methods on `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`.
- Many convenience methods have been removed. In all cases, the same functionality is available using other Temporal methods:
  - Removed `getISOFields()` methods. Instead use `withCalendar('iso8601')` and the individual property getters.
  - Removed `withPlainDate()` methods. Instead use `with({ year, monthCode, day })`.
  - Removed `toPlainDateTime()` and `toZonedDateTime()` methods of `Temporal.PlainTime`. Instead use the same-named methods on `Temporal.PlainDate` to combine a date and a time.
  - Removed `epochSeconds` and `epochMicroseconds` properties. Instead calculate epoch seconds with `Math.floor(epochMilliseconds / 1000)` and epoch microseconds with `epochNanoseconds / 1000n + ((epochNanoseconds % 1000n) < 0n ? -1n : 0n)`.
  - Removed `toPlainYearMonth()` and `toPlainMonthDay()` methods of `Temporal.PlainDateTime` and `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`. Instead use `toPlainDate()` and then the methods on `Temporal.PlainDate`.
  - Removed `Temporal.Instant.prototype.toZonedDateTime` and `Temporal.Now.zonedDateTime`. Instead use `toZonedDateTimeISO()`/`zonedDateTimeISO()` to create a `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` object using the ISO8601 calendar, and then use `withCalendar()` if a non-ISO calendar is desired.
- The `relativeTo` parameter is no longer accepted in `Temporal.Duration.prototype.add` and `subtract`. Instead take the `relativeTo` object, add the two durations to it, and difference it with the original using `until()`.
- Throw if there are multiple calendar annotations in a string and one has the critical flag ([Proposal PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2572))
- Changed the way calculations are done with `Temporal.Duration`, and placed limits on each of the units. Years, months, and weeks are each limited to 2³²−1. The other units (days through nanoseconds) are collectively limited: taken together, they must be less than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` seconds plus 999,999,999 nanoseconds. This has few user-visible changes, but it does mean that some durations are no longer allowed (for example, `Temporal.Duration.from({ seconds: Number.MAX_VALUE })`.) ([Proposal PR 1](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2722), [PR 2](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2727), [PR 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2612))
- Offset time zones are now limited to minutes precision. That is, you can have `[+01:01]` but not `[+01:00:01]` or `[+01:00:00.000000001]` ([Proposal PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2607))
- For APIs that take a string, other primitives are no longer coerced to strings. Technically, you could previously do `Temporal.PlainDate.from(20230711)` and it would be treated as `Temporal.PlainDate.from("20230711")`. This is no longer the case. ([Proposal PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2574))
- `Temporal.PlainYearMonth.prototype.toPlainDate` and `Temporal.PlainMonthDay.prototype.toPlainDate` now have clamping behaviour instead of throwing if the resulting PlainDate would be invalid. For example, `birthday.toPlainDate({ year: 2025 })` will now return February 28, 2025 if the birthday in question if February 29. ([Proposal PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2718))
  - If you still want the throwing behaviour, you can get it more verbosely:
  ```js
  const { monthCode, day } = birthday;
  Temporal.PlainDate.from({ year: 2025, monthCode, day }, { overflow: 'reject' });
  ```
- Not all calendars have a week numbering scheme, so `weekOfYear` and `yearOfWeek` methods may now return `undefined` ([Proposal PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2756))
- In `Temporal.Duration.prototype.round()`, rounding to a >1 increment of a calendar `smallestUnit` while simultaneously balancing to a calendar `largestUnit` is now disallowed and will throw ([Proposal PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2916))
- Creating a `Temporal.MonthDay` in a non-ISO8601 calendar will now throw if the year is too far (>¼ million years) in the future or past ([Proposal PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/3054))

Bug fixes:

- Fixed several bugs in duration calculations, particularly rounding ([Proposal PR 1](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2571), [PR 2](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2758), [PR 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2759), [PR 4](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2797), [PR 5](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2810))
- Fixed a bug in start-of-day calculations ([Proposal PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2918))
- Many small bug fixes to bring the polyfill into better compliance with the Temporal proposal

Non-breaking changes

- Many improvements in performance and bundle size
- Remove runtime dependency on tslib. Now this package has only one runtime dependency: JSBI (a polyfill for `BigInt`)
- Update dev dependencies
- Support Node 20.x and test it in CI

# 0.4.4

Breaking changes:

- `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` objects are no longer supported as parameters to `Intl.DateTimeFormat` formatting methods. ([12071fb0], see also [Upstream PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2479), [Upstream PR 2](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2522))
  - To format using `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`'s time zone, use `Temporal.ZonedDateTime.prototype.toLocaleString`. This method:
    1. Creates a new `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instance in the same time zone and calendar as the `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` instance
    1. Creates a `Temporal.Instant` from the `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` instance.
    1. Formats that `Temporal.Instant` instance using the created `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instance.
  - To format in a time zone that does not match the time zone of the `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` instance:
    1. Create a new `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` instance in the right time zone using `Temporal.ZonedDateTime.prototype.withTimeZone`.
       - To get the current system time zone, use `Temporal.Now.timeZoneId()`.
         Be careful when caching the current system time zone (or an `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instance using that time zone), because the system time zone can change during the lifetime of your program (e.g. when a user on a mobile device crosses a time zone boundary or when a user manually edits time zone settings).
    1. Follow the steps above.
  - Generally, try to always include the `timeZone` property when creating an `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instance to avoid an ambiguity about which time zone the formatted results will be in.
  - `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instances can be expensive to create. For performance-sensitive code where the same calendar and time zone are used repeatedly for formatting, we recommend creating and reusing an `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instance with the desired `timeZone` and `calendar` options, and then formatting using the value of `Temporal.ZonedDateTime.prototype.epochMilliseconds`.
    `Intl.DateTimeFormat` instances may also require a lot of RAM, so indefinitely caching large numbers of them is not recommended for memory-constrained environments.
- The `.calendar` property on Temporal types has been replaced with a `.calendarId` property that returns the string calendar identifier and a `.getCalendar()` method that returns an object that implements `Temporal.CalendarProtocol`.
  - `getCalendar()` will always return a new object if the containing instance was constructed using a built-in calendar identifier string. However, if the containing instance was constructed using a calendar object (either a built-in calendar or custom calendar), then the same object is returned. ([cc701b45], see also [Upstream issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1808))
  - Temporal will compare calendars by testing for string equality between calendar identifiers.
    When a calendar is an object, its `id` property will be used for comparison. ([3916e547], see also [Upstream issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1808))
  - The `.calendar` property has been entirely removed from `Temporal.PlainTime`. ([0727d86e], see also [Issue 1](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1808), [Issue 2](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1588))
- The `.timeZone` property on `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` has been replaced with a `.timeZoneId` property that returns the string time zone identifier and a `.getTimeZone()` method that returns an object that implements `Temporal.TimeZoneProtocol`. ([d3263f0], see also Upstream issue)
  - `getTimeZone()` will always return a new object if the `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` instance was constructed using a built-in time zone identifier string.
    However, if the instance was constructed using a time zone object (either a built-in time zone or custom time zone), then the same object is returned.
  - `Termporal.Now.timeZone()` is replaced by `Temporal.Now.timeZoneId()`, which returns a time zone identifier string, not a `Temporal.TimeZone` instance. ([600f0cc7], see also [Upstream issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1808))
  - Temporal will compare time zones by testing for string equality between calendar identifiers.
    When a calendar is an object, its `id` property will be used for comparison. ([d6cb2862], see also [Upstream issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1808))
- Require the `id` property and make overriding `toString` optional (but recommended!) for `Temporal.TimeZoneProtocol`. ([97637bbc])
- Remove support for nested time zone and calendar property bags. ([9b7f61ae], [0c38267b], see also [Discussion](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2104#issuecomment-140))
- Require the remainder returned by the `NanosecondsToDays` internal operation to be less than the length of one calendar day.
  This could happen due to shenanigans in a custom time zone's `getOffsetNanosecondsFor` or `getPossibleInstantsFor` methods, or a custom calendar's `dateAdd` method.
  ([44b00a38], see also [Upstream issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2357)
- Set an upper limit of 1e9 on rounding increments. ([5d78c815])
- Require `fields` and `mergeFields` methods for `Temporal.CalendarProtocol` (custom calendar) objects. ([5ad63274])
- Reject Z designators when parsing `Temporal.PlainTime` strings.

Bug fixes:

- Read field identifiers from a calendar's `fields()` method during `dateFromFields()`, `yearMonthFromFields()`, and `monthDayFromFields()`.
  Previously, these methods only referenced hardcoded `'era'` and `'eraYear'` field identifiers. ([375a4ad9])
- Avoid precision loss in AddDuration operations. ([c0f7349a])
- Fix an infinite-loop bug and a RangeError during non-ISO calendar calculations. ([d94c1cd9], see also [proposal-temporal PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2539), [Issue 1](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2383), [Issue 2](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2537))
- Avoid rounding errors in `BalanceTime` operations. ([9260a8a0])
- Avoid precision loss in `NanosecondsToDays` operations. ([e02f0626])
- Require that results from `NanosecondsToDays` calls don't flip sign. ([0b238ccf])
- Fix bugs introduced while restricting the creation of `Temporal.Duration` using non-numeric inputs. ([46c4132d], see also [Upstream issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2112))
- Fix bugs when passing fractional numbers to `CreateTemporalDuration`. ([856a5460], see also [Upstream issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2246))
- Always return a Number of nanoseconds from `RoundDuration`. ([8d3c1f1b])
- Use BigInt math in `RoundDuration` to avoid problems when the values are larger than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`. ([955323f8])
- Always start at the end of 1972 when computing a `Temporal.PlainMonthDay` from fields, preventing the reference year from accidentally being in 1971. ([ef4a0c4b])
- Apply the overflow behaviour to year/month/day values in `monthDayFromFields`. ([7ebd0f96])
- Preserve the day of month when constraining a nonexistent leap month, instead of defaulting to the end of the closest corresponding regular month. ([996f8fa1])
- Allow month codes `'M01L'` and `'M12L'` in the Chinese calendar. ([696f2c7e])
- Avoid overflows in `GetNamedTimeZoneOffsetNanoseconds`. ([c42570b8])
- Fix calendar validation in various ToTemporal\_\_\_ operations. ([e3913974], see also [Upstream issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2546))
- Don't call `GetMethod` on a string calendar. ([fe698d8d], see also [Upstream issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2547))
- Avoid rounding errors in `BalanceDurationRelative` and `UnbalanceDurationRelative`. ([a907acf0])
- Check for negative day length in `Temporal.ZonedDateTime.prototype.round`. ([0d2d60ec], see also [Spec PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/2261))
  This change avoids a common bug where a UTC timestamp is accidentally interpreted as if it were a local time in a real time zone.
  If you do want to parse the time portion of a UTC timestamp string, use: `Temporal.Instant.from(s).toZonedDateTimeISO('UTC').toPlainTime()`. ([a7a50eac])
- Reject 0-value components when parsing `Temporal.Duration` strings, and avoid rounding errors when nanoseconds components are present. ([58b5601a])
- Reject `relativeTo` string options that are neither valid `Temporal.PlainDate` nor `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` strings, such as `'2022-08-18T17:01Z'`. ([4db15c41])
- Add validation for the return values from calendar operations. ([d88cfa4d])
- Validate required methods of `Temporal.TimeZoneProtocol` and `Temporal.CalendarProtocol`. ([84563cea], [755c7620], see also [Discussion](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2104#issuecomment-140))
- Throw earlier when users might mix up positional `Temporal.TimeZone` and `Temporal.Calendar` arguments with each other, to prevent bugs like `new Temporal.ZonedDateTime(0n, cal, tz)` where the switched calendar and time zone arguments would cause exceptions to be thrown later. ([7922f1f9])

Non-breaking changes:

- Implement `yearOfWeek` methods that complement existing `weekOfYear` methods.
  The new method returns the year associated with `weekOfYear`, which may (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) vary from `year` in some calendars like `'iso8601'`.
  This new method can be useful for formatting IS0 8601 strings using the year-week-day format like `1981-W53-7`. ([bf08ca56])
- Support new Internet Extended Date-Time (IXDTF) Annotations
  - See the [Temporal + IXDTF tracking issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/1450).
  - Align ISO 8601 grammar with annotations from IXDTF specification.
    Calendar and time zone annotations are now allowed to contain a "critical" flag (`'!'`) prefix.
    Critical flags have no effect when parsing input strings because Temporal already treats unknown or inconsistent inputs as errors by default. ([e8b2e71c])
    - There can be multiple types of annotations in an IXDTF string.
      Temporal only recognizes time zone and calendar annotations.
      Unrecognized non-critical annotations will be ignored.
      Unrecognized critical annotations will cause the parsing method to throw an exception.
  - Allow `toString()` methods for `Temporal.PlainDate`, `Temporal.PlainDateTime`, `Temporal.PlainYearMonth`, `Temporal.PlainMonthDay`, and `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` to emit critical IXDTF annotations using the `'critical'` option.
    Use this option with care, because the platform that you're communicating with may not understand this syntax.
    `calendarName: 'critical'` behaves like `calendarName: 'always'` and `timeZoneName: 'critical'` behaves like `timeZoneName: 'always'`, but they also output a `'!'` prefix in the corresponding annotation. ([50a64f16])
    Critical flags are never used by Temporal, but could be consumed by other programs.
  - Ignore calendar annotations when parsing `Temporal.Instant` strings. ([b86b87f0])
  - Allow calendar and/or time zone annotations after strings without a time part: YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM, and MM-DD. ([acd6464f])
  - Disallow UTC offsets in YYYY-MM and MM-DD strings because they could cause ambiguity between an offset and the day of a YYYY-MM-DD string. ([acd6464f])
  - Reject ambiguous time strings even with calendar annotations. ([af875275])
- Implement the full set of rounding modes.
  New modes include `'expand'`, `'halfCeil'`, `'halfFloor'`, `'halfTrunc'`, and `'halfEven'`.
  ([eb5404d1])
- Treat calendar names as case-insensitive. ([9e730d68])
- Improve cross-binary compatibility of polyfill objects by storing internals on `globalThis`. ([73a0bf36], see also [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/js-temporal/temporal-polyfill/issues/164))
- Allow various `Temporal.Calendar` methods to return 0. ([8a49023b])
- Improve error messages when converting fields to a `Temporal.PlainMonthDay`. ([e1cd4170])
- Round towards the Big Bang in epoch time getters. ([6d124a56], see also [Upstream issue](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2423), [Spec change](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/2424))
- Improve performance when operating on large numbers in `BalanceISODate`. ([d2a23dd5])
- Optimize `Temporal.TimeZone.prototype.getNextTransition()` for dates that predate 1847, which is the earliest data in the IANA time zone database. ([9591af3b])
- Improve performance when out-of-range finding transition points for named time zones. ([3b61abfe])
- Special-case zones with precomputed DST transition points in `GetPreviousTransition`. ([5922bdf1])

Other:

- Bump required dependency versions. ([c65455a5])
- Fix sourcemaps so they point directly to TS source files. ([6b462d49], see also [GitHub PR](https://github.com/js-temporal/temporal-polyfill/pull/194))

# 0.4.3

# 0.4.0

This version roughly corresponds with all the changes made to the Temporal polyfill as of the January 2022 TC39 Plenary meeting.

Breaking changes:

- Use JSBI instead of big-integer for Big Integer math operations. If your codebase does not need to polyfill BigInt, consider using [the JSBI Babel plugin](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/babel-plugin-transform-jsbi-to-bigint) to transpile these operations to native BigInt.
- Reject plain date-only strings ([b733c213], see also [Spec PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/1952), [proposal-temporal polyfill PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/1986))

- Run tests against Node 17 on CI ([db63e22a])

# 0.3.0

This version roughly corresponds with all the changes made to the Temporal polyfill as of the October 2021 TC39 Plenary meeting.

Breaking changes:

- Timezones now require a `getOffsetNanosecondsFor` method, and no longer fall back to the intrinsic definition (previously provided by `Temporal.Timezone#getOffsetNanosecondsFor`) if not provided. ([08346dc5], see also [proposal-temporal polyfill PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/1929))
- Disallow Z designators when parsing strings for Plain Temporal types ([f3f8a994], see also [Spec PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/1874))

- Fix TS types of RoundTo and TotalOf ([3008a670])
- Fix crash setting `day` outside current JPN era ([6d3588c3], see also [proposal-temporal polyfill PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/1807))
- Copy options object for PlainYearMonth.{add,subtract} and InterpretTemporalDateTimeFields to prevent user-modified objects from interfering with later operations. ([bafa1bdf], see also [Spec PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/1748))
- Validate input to Calendar.prototype.fields ([7ebc700e], see also [Spec PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/1750))
- Stop observably calling into `getPossibleInstantsFor` in `InterpretISODateTimeOffset` ([5448e59f], see also [Spec PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/1688))

Non-breaking changes:

- Various `#round` and `#total` methods now accept string parameters or options bags. Strings are interpreted as the `smallestUnit` option (or `unit` for `Temporal.Duration#total`). ([068e801f], see also [Spec PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/1875))
- Add @@toStringTag to TS types ([41ab6bc0])
- Accept string Calendar names in PlainMonthDay and PlainYearMonth constructors ([27b4c7e8])
- Make options optional in Calendar method TS types ([3a09d00d])
- Align implementation of RoundDuration with adjusted spec text ([4a0d0264], see also [Spec PR](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/pull/1968/files))

Other:

- Bump various dependencies ([47701107], [f5427de9], [310d9d8b])
